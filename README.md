# News Aggregator Assignment

## Overview

This assignment builds a simple search engine with autocomplete for a collection of news articles.

It is based on [this assignment](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit5940/current/assignments/hw06/). 

If the above link does not work, you can also find a PDF version in the `docs/` folder.

## Included Files

### Autocomplete

From a previous assignment, I've copied over the following files, and did not modify them.

```text
Autocomplete.java
IAutocomplete.java
ITerm.java
Node.java
Term.java
ByPrefixOrder.java
ByReverseWeightOrder.java
```

### Starter Files

I used the assignment starter files without any modification. This means they still contain bugs from their original implementation.

This includes:

```text
AutocompletePanel.java
IIndexBuilder.java
NewsAggregator.java
```

### Jsoup

I've included a `jar` file for the Jsoup library, which is used to make network requests.

### Others

All other files were written by me. 

## Testing

Test coverage report is available in `docs/html_test_coverage_report`.
